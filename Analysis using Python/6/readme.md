 # Pandas
 
 Pandas is the dominant python data analysis package
 - Pandas is built on top of NumPy so it's very fast. And it extends NumPy in ways that are extremely useful to data analysis. 
 - For instance it attaches labels to table columns and rows. It lets us access data using indexes built from any variable. 
 - It allows us to modify table structure by adding and dropping columns and by performing other transformations.
 - It recognizes many common data formats. It handles missing data easily. It implements database operations such as joins and it can even make plots.
